# Assignment
Use the `MediaItems` table from the previous course and create a PHP application that allows you to insert, update, select, and delete records from the table using PDO and prepared statements.

You need a form for inserting and updating records and a html table for selecting and deleting records.

Start by creating the html table and the form for inserting records. Then create the PHP scripts for inserting and selecting records. After that, create the form for updating records and the PHP script for updating records. Finally, create the PHP script for deleting records.

Use existing user_id and hard code into the form as a hidden field for inserting, updating and deleting records. Also add a couple existing filenames to the form as a dropdown list, so you don't have to manually input the filenames every time.
